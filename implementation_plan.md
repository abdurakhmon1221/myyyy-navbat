# Navbat Master Polish: The Consumer Experience

This plan outlines the final enhancements for the "my Navbat" ecosystem, focusing on the Client-facing experience and global application quality.

## 1. Client App Overhaul (Premium Consumer UX)
- [ ] **AI-Powered Command Center**: Add a futuristic voice/text command sheet that allows users to say "Bankka navbat ol" (Join queue for bank) or "Eng yaqin sartarosh".
- [ ] **Bento Dashboard**: Redesign the home screen with a modern Bento-grid layout for active queues, favorites, and recommendations.
- [ ] **Immersive Map Mode**: Upgrade the map into a full-screen immersive experience with custom markers and "Street View" style previews.
- [ ] **Dynamic Theming**: Implement "Adaptive Color Sync" where the app's accent color changes based on the organization the user is currently interacting with.
- [ ] **Service Virtualization**: Add a "Virtual Walkthrough" for services, showing users exactly what documents they need with a checklist UI.

## 2. Global System Refinements
- [ ] **Master Search**: A system-wide search (`Cmd+K` style) for Organizations, Services, and FAQs.
- [ ] **Haptic Feedback 2.0**: Deeper integration of tactile sensations for different actions (error, success, calling, cancelling).
- [ ] **Performance Pass**: Optimize Recharts and heavy components to ensure 60fps on mobile devices.
- [ ] **SEO & Metadata**: Finalize the SEOMetadata component to dynamic support social sharing for organizations.

## 3. Marketing & Landing (The Face of Navbat)
- [ ] **Public Landing Page**: A high-conversion landing page at the root/index for new users, featuring 3D mobile mockups and value propositions.

## Next Step:
Start with the **AI Command Center** and **Bento Dashboard** in `ClientView.tsx`.
